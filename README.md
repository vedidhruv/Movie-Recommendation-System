<h2>About</h2>
<p>In this project I have built a content based movie recommendation system using machine learning. The algorithm recommends products that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in the past. This similarity (generally cosine similarity) is computed from the data we have about the items as well as the userâ€™s past preferences.</p>
